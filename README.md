First and foremost, the goal of this project is to provide the user with an abundance of feline imageryâ€”which it currently isn't very good at. However, it is capable of downloading and tagging music from the interwebz that is otherwise hard to acquire.

**Supported sites:**

* [8tracks.com](https://8tracks.com/)

**In development:**

* [songza.com](https://songza.com/)

## Developer Setup

**Prerequisites:**

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

**Get the omgcatz stuff:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cadejscroggins/omgcatz && cd omgcatz
```

**Initialize the virtual machine:**

```bash
vagrant up
```

_Note: If on Windows ensure that you run this command from an Administrator prompt due to symlink requirments of archive action._

**Run the omgcatz setup script:**

```bash
vagrant ssh -c "sudo /var/www/html/_install/setup.sh"
```

The MySQL username is `root` and the password is `vagrant`.

**That's it!**

You can access the site at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes on Windows users have noticed they are unable to run the setup script. It could be to do with how Windows and Unix like operating systems handle line endings. To fix this try:

1. SSH into your virtual machine, either using PuTTY or `vagrant ssh`
2. `sudo apt-get install dos2unix`
3. `dos2unix /var/www/html/_install/setup.sh`
4. Now try running the setup script again!
